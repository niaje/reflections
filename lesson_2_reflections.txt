What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  A git repository is created, though it doesnt show any commits yet. 
  We need to initialise a repository so that we can have git track the files in that repositoty. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area holds the content before it is commited, and it shous you changes or files to be comitted.

  while the working directory contains all files including those the repository

  the repository contains files being tracked by git

  The staging areas value is that it gives you a picture of what changes you would like to commit and an opptunity to manage the files to be commited.
